Jbook project created for a Udemy class
Credit to Stephen Grider and his course React and Typescript: Build a Portfolio Project

I chose to not use NPM to deploy the project as was instructed because there would be to many similar names

This for now prevents the saving and loading function from working properly.

Will format later

How to use:

Run site with `lerna run start`

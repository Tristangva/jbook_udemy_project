Jbook project created for a Udemy class
Credit to Stephen Grider and his course React and Typescript: Build a Portfolio Project

I chose to not use NPM in the long run to deploy the project as was instructed because there would be to many similar names

However for now I will use it


How to use:

Install with: `npm `

Run site with `lerna run start`

Remake with `lerna start`
